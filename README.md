## User Story


AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data

## Code Source
I was able to work with Yvonne, Jack "Alexis", Malcolm, Jemeric, Dan Jones over the weekend at a Study Group session through Zoom. Went through Xpert, youtube, MDN webDocs.

I had to redo the program 4 times, due to errors or didn't download the GitHub Fork correctly. 

Worked with my TA's on afterhours. # JavaScript
